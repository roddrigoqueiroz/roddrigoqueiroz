# Hello World!

I'm a Software Developer who enjoys building applications with Angular and C#/.NET. Currently, I'm part of the team at SegImob, contributing to projects in the insurance technology sector.

While pursuing my degree in Information Systems at UFU, I also dedicate time to personal projects that challenge me. My curiosity for technology extends from modern web development to the intricacies of low-level programming, which you can see in my NES-dev repository.

I also enjoy collaborating on creative projects, like "Astro Oddity," a game I helped develop for our OOP2 course.
